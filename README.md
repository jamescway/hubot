HomeRun's Hubot
==============

It's already running *in the cloud* (Heroku). Just `gem install heroku` in whatever ruby you want, and after telling someone that you want to be able to push to the heroku repository for this hubot you should be able to make changes and push them up. No biggie. - Jose
